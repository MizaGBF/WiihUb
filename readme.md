# WiihUb  
* Simple Media Server for the Wii U  
* Work in progress  
# Features  
Flexible and simple plugin system. Currently support:  
* Streamlink calls to receive Twitch streams on your Wii U (Twitch is now broken on the Wii U Browser).  
* Screenshot upload (for ease of use).  
* 4chan Thread search (The search doesn't work anymore on the Wii U Browser).  
* Twitter Browsing (It will stop working soon on the Wii U Browser).  
* E-Pub reader (Support e-pub 2 and 3).  
* Mangadex Loader (for when chapters don't load).  
For the installation, check what each plugin requires.  
# Note  
I don't plan on actively supporting this project, I'm just putting it here for backup purpose.
